00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
So now we've got  Chris here.

2
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,260
Chris, what are you doing here?

3
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,020
What made you come here?

4
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,260
I came here to see Tom.

5
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,720
He's told me a little bit about
the project here last year when I came

6
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,040
to visit him and yeah,
I thought I'd come and check it out.

7
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,700
He's very excited about it.

8
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,960
It's a nice day.

9
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,600
It's a Sunday.
Why not?

10
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,760
And you're getting a tour in a couple

11
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,160
of minutes. What do you know already?
Which tool are you most excited about?

12
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,720
Honestly, I have no idea.

13
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,900
Well enjoy the tour and check
out all the tools we've got.

14
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you very much.
